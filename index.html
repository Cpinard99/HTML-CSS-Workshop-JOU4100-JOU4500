            <h1>Placelessness</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Pinard’s Place, a space for you to indulge, interpret, and engage. 
As humans we thrive off of our external and internal world. The balance between the two offers an individual a sense of belonging and purpose. A sense of self is ultimately discovered through modes of expression where one is able to reflect and understand not only their thought process but overall aspects of life and mind. 
</p>
            <p>I am on my road to self-discovery, pursuing the things that bring light to my reality. This space of expression will allow me to share thoughts and experiences that question the underlying aspects of society and the functionality of the world as a whole. This platform will be rooted with not only diverse perspective but a peak into my creative side.
I invite you to join me on this exploration and adopt outlets that harmonize your intake and perspective of the world around you.

            <h2>Feeling Blocked?</h2>
              <p>You won’t understand your purpose in a day, and you might struggle with expressing but that’s okay. A block is simply just a block, the only way to get through it, <a href="https://goinswriter.com/how-to-overcome-writers-block/" target="_blank">is write through it.</a></p>
              
            <p>As mentioned by author Jeff Goins, the common causes for a writers block are: 
                     
            <ol>
              <li>Timing </li>
              <li>Fear</li>
                <li>Perfectionism</li>
              </ol> 
            
              <p>Fear is just false evidence appearing real, an illusion limiting our potential. Don’t be afraid and put your ideas to work. Face everything and rise to the purest version of yourself.
