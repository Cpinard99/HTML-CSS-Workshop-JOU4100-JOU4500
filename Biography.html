        <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
            <p>Growing up in Ontario's Tomato captial with only a population of 27, 596 people offered me expriences a big city cannot. Living only a few minutes away from
                <a href="https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/on/pelee" target="_blank">Point Pelee National Park </a> offered me a little getaway, a home inside a home. With just me, the trees, and my pen and paper, these moments allowed me to take advantage of the stillness of my surroundings. These moments are what inspire my writing and what have assisted me in discovering my passions.</p>
              <p>Who is Chanelle Pinard? Just another person you passed in the city who's in pursuit of a big dream. I am currently in my second year at the University of Ottawa completing my Bachelor's in Digital Journalism. Once I accomplish this joint program with the Algonquin College I intend to intern for <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com"target="_blank"> National Geographic</a> in Toronto. With this opportunity I hope to one day travel the world as one of their photo journalists and to eventually create an organization of my own. </p> 
              <h2>Future Goals? </h2>
            <p>Succeeeding my travels I will take the knowledge I have gathered and interpretd in devotion to enlightening a variety of viewpoints. With doing so I plan to publish a novel in ambition to teach and inspire.</p>
              
              <p> <li>Expression and Reflection Groups</li> 
             <blockquote> The outlets that I have utilized have emboldened me to instill the positive aspects of these techniques into the minds of those who are open and passionate about sharing their thoughts. <br> It's all about perspective. It's up to you to decide what you think is right or wrong but any perspective is just a form of expression, a mirror or our being. Through the form of:
                 <li>Painting</li>
                 <li>writing</li>
                 <li>Theatre</li>
                 <li>Photography and film</li>
                 <li>Working out</li>
                 <li>Yoga or meditation</li> <br>
                 
        One is able to express and reflect. There are many methods used to cope with the internal and external world but I find that these forms of creativity allow the vulnerbility of expression to flow. Expression groups will invite those who are not afraid to face their truest thoughts, a space to be honest with the feeling of that very moment. At the beginning of each session I will give the group a prompting idea or word and a specific outlet or platform to express a response. They will have a time limit to complete the project and present (if willing) to the rest of the peers in this process of reflection.</blockquote>
